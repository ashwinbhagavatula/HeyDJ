# HeyDJ
A web application that has arisen from the problem of not being able to ask your DJ in the bar or pub you're in to play the song you so want to listen to.

 With this people can search for their favourite song and upvote it and based on the number of upvotes the song is placed between the top to bottom ranking in the queue. 
 The DJ knows what the crowd wants to hear and can play his set accordingly
